Planetary game engine

This was my first attempt at some kind of graphics engine, 
so there is no collision detection, no fancy stuff, just the 
basics. It loads models and skyboxes, and it has a prevailing 
acceleration down, So you need to hold the spacebar to stay
afloat.

Controls:
w	->	Forward
a	->	Strafe Left
s	->	Backward
d	->	Strafe Right
space	->	Jump
esc	->	Quit

To play the executable alone, you have to put the following files
and directories in the same directory:

Player
Terrain
Blaze Game Engine.exe
ground08.tga
m_bk.tga
m_dn.tga
m_ft.tga
m_lt.tga
m_rt.tga
m_up.tga
m_bk.tga
