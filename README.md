Planetary game engine

I went through a couple iterations of engines between Blaze Game
Engine 0.01 and this. During that time, I implemented a sound
library for Mac OS X, I implemented basic collision detection and
response, I developed a very basic water effect, I implemented
a heightmap loader, and I developed a particle engine.
